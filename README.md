# API Hub | Adoption Roadmaps

This repository contains comprehensive 12-month customer success roadmaps for each module of the API Hub. These roadmaps are designed for Customer Success Managers (CSMs) to help guide customers through implementation, adoption, and value realization during their first year with the product.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three folders, each containing a detailed customer success roadmap for a specific tool:

- **PactFlow** - Contract testing implementation roadmap
- **SwaggerHub** - API design-first implementation roadmap  
- **SwaggerHub-Portal** - API documentation and developer portal roadmap

Each folder contains a markdown (.md) file with a structured 12-month plan including monthly activities, success metrics, check-in schedules, and common challenges with solutions.

## Purpose

These roadmaps serve multiple purposes:

1. **Guide implementation** - Provide a step-by-step approach to successful implementation
2. **Track progress** - Define clear success criteria for each stage of the journey
3. **Measure ROI** - Establish metrics to demonstrate business value
4. **Overcome challenges** - Anticipate and address common obstacles
5. **Standardize approach** - Create consistency in customer success delivery

## Common Roadmap Structure

Each roadmap follows a similar structure:

1. **Introduction** - Overview and phased approach
2. **Success Metrics & KPIs** - Key metrics to track ROI
3. **Month-by-Month Schedule** - Detailed monthly activities and success criteria
4. **Key Check-in Calls** - Schedule and agenda for important milestone meetings
5. **Common Challenges & Solutions** - Practical solutions to implementation obstacles
6. **Resources** - Documentation, training, and implementation resources

## Usage Guidelines

These roadmaps are intended to be starting points that can be customized for each customer's unique needs. CSMs should:

- Review and adapt the roadmap with the customer during onboarding
- Adjust timelines based on customer resources and priorities
- Focus on the metrics most relevant to the customer's business goals
- Add customer-specific activities and success criteria where appropriate
