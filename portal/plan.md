## Introduction

This document serves as a guide for Customer Success Managers (CSMs) supporting customers during their first 12 months with SwaggerHub Portal. It outlines a structured approach to ensure customers successfully implement an API developer portal that increases API discovery and adoption, improves the developer experience, and establishes effective feedback loops with API consumers.

The plan assumes a phased approach:
- **Months 1-3**: Initial setup, branding, and publishing pilot APIs
- **Months 4-6**: Enhancing documentation, implementing feedback mechanisms
- **Months 7-9**: Scaling content, analytics implementation, community building
- **Months 10-12**: Measuring adoption ROI, strategic planning for year 2

## Success Metrics & KPIs

Track these key metrics to demonstrate the ROI of SwaggerHub Portal:

### API Discovery & Adoption Metrics
- **API discovery time**: Reduction in time for developers to find relevant APIs
- **API onboarding time**: Reduction in time from discovery to first successful API call
- **API traffic growth**: % increase in API calls after Portal implementation
- **New API consumer acquisition**: Number of new developers/teams consuming APIs
- **Cross-API adoption**: Average number of different APIs used per consumer

### Developer Experience Metrics
- **Developer satisfaction**: Survey scores from API consumers
- **Support ticket reduction**: % decrease in API usage support requests
- **Time to first successful call**: Reduction in time from reading docs to successful implementation
