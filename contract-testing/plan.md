## Introduction

This document serves as a guide for Customer Success Managers (CSMs) supporting customers during their first 12 months with Contract Testing. It outlines a structured approach to ensure customers achieve a successful implementation, maximize adoption, and realize measurable ROI from their contract testing investment.

The plan assumes a phased approach:
- **Months 1-3**: Initial setup, pilot implementation, training
- **Months 4-6**: Expanding adoption, integrating into CI/CD
- **Months 7-9**: Scaling across teams, optimizing workflows
- **Months 10-12**: Measuring ROI, strategic planning for year 2

## Success Metrics & KPIs

Track these key metrics to demonstrate the ROI of contract testing with Contract Testing:

### Technical Metrics
- **Decrease in integration issues**: % reduction in integration bugs found in testing/production
- **Reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR)**: Time saved diagnosing API integration issues
- **Build pipeline efficiency**: % reduction in build failures due to API contract issues
- **Test coverage**: % of critical API interactions covered by contract tests
- **Verification speed**: Time saved in verification compared to end-to-end testing

### Business Metrics
- **Development acceleration**: % reduction in time spent on integration testing
- **Release frequency improvement**: Increase in deployment frequency
- **Cost savings**: Reduction in QA/testing costs and developer time spent on integration issues
- **Cross-team collaboration**: Improved collaboration between frontend/backend/API teams

### Adoption Metrics
- **Active projects**: Number of projects using Pact for contract testing
